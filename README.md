# FPS sandbox

This is a Godot playground, that I use to practice various concepts, related to the FPS (first-person shooter) development.

For the moment, it covers following aspects:

- FPS controller
- Objects interaction
- Doors
- Destroyable lighting
- Simple enemy behaviour (guard, chase, shoot to player)
- Multiple weapons and switching between weapons (buttons, mouse wheel)
- Weapon sway effect
- Fire distance
- Bullets
- UI (crosshair, health bar, ammo counter, ammo type)
- Crosshair has 2 modes: active (if possible to shoot), default (if not possible to shoot or while reloading)
- Items pickup
- Camera switching (first person camera/third person camera)
- Healthbars for enemies

The project was built with Godot v.3.2.3. Tested on Windows 10.
