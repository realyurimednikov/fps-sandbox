# FPS sandbox

This is just a sandbox Godot project, that I use to practice various concepts, related to the FPS (first-person shooter) development. For a moment, it covers following aspects:

- FPS controller
- Objects interaction
- Simple enemy behaviour
- Multiple weapons and switching
- Bullets
- UI (crosshair, health bar, ammo counters)
- Items pickup
- Camera switching (first person camera/third person camera)

The project was built with Godot Engine 3.
